**Back Ground and Aim:** 

![](jost1.jpg "Fig.1 δ13C records compilation from different sections in the world,note the largest excursion in Chaotian section.(Jost et al., 2014,EPSL)")

A large carbon isotope excursion(over 8 ‰) has been documented at the end of Capitanian in South China and its cause has been elusive\[2]. Different explanations has been aroused but robust evidence is still not available. These explanations include:1) The light carbon bringing by upwelling currents from deep ocean\[3]; 2)The light carbon from re-oxidated organic matter in the strata\[2]; 3) Light carbon from volcanic activity(The Emeishan Large Igneous Province)\[4]. In this study, we use element content to decode the palaeoenvironment information(upwelling character, redox condition, primary productivity) of  a well preserved section(the Shangsi section) in South China and try to provide some information behind the excursion.

**Methods：**

Major and Trace element analysis ; Bulk rock carbon isotope analysis; TOC; Thin Section Observation

**Present Progress:**

（1）three pulse of primary productivity increase have been observed but have weak to zero relationship with upwelling. Other source of nutrients for primary producer in euphotic zone is favored.

（2）Supplementary evidence from the overlying clay bed( Wangpo bed) indicates volcanic origin of light carbon due to the degassing of volcanic rock.
