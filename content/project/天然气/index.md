**Back Ground and Aim:**

The significance of Wangpo bed, a clay bed overlying the Permian Maokou Formation, in proving the causal relationship between Emeishan volcanic activity(Emeishan Large Igneous Province) and End-Guadalupian Mass Extinction event has long been proposed since it formed contemporaneously with the two events(Isozaki et al., 2004; He et al.,2010), but the origin  and the mechanism that formed this bed has long been under controversy:

(1) A ELIP silicic origin for Wangpo bed has been proposed (Isozaki et al., 2004), but ELIP mafic rock origin has also been reported (He et al.,2010);

(2) Whether it was formed by detrital rock from ELIP(He et al.,2010; Deconinck et al., 2014) or was formed by altered volcanic ash in submarine environment is also under controversy (Isozaki et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2017).  

In this study, samples from a well preserved section( Shangsi section) has been collected to provide new insights of the origin and possible mechanism of this bed.

**Methods:**

Bulk Rock XRD, Major and Trace Element, Scanning Electronic Microscope, Optical Microscope, U-Pb dating

**Present Progress:**

(1)Mineralogy characters,such as vermicular  kaolinite, anatase, plagioclase indicate a volcanic origin instead of detrital origin as previously reported. 

(2)Element contend and ratios indicate Wangpo bed has more similarity with the silicic volcanic rocks(<5% of the whole volcanic piles ) of Emeishan Large Lgneous Province.

(3)The unique submarine eruption character and accompanied SO2 degassing,  ocean acidification maybe the trigger of the mass extinction event.
