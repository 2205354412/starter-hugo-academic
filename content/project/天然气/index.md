**Back Ground and Aim:**

The significance of Wangpo bed, a clay bed overlying the Permian Maokou Formation, in proving the causal relationship between Emeishan volcanic activity(Emeishan Large Igneous Province) and End-Guadalupian Mass Extinction event has long been addressed since it formed contemporaneously with the two events, but the origin  and the mechanism that forms this bed has long been under controversy. In this study, samples from a well preserved section( Shangsi section) has been collected to provide new insights of the origin and possible mechanism of this bed.
