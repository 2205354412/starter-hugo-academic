Master degree research project, supervised by Prof Jian Cao.

The cause of the end-Guadalupian Mass Extinction(EGME) event has been under dispute for a long time. Previous age constraints pointed the Emeishan Large Ingenious Province(ELIP) as the trigger, but vigorous evidence still did not exist. Wangpo bed, a clay bed formed at the end of Guadalupian, has long been believed as the key a study the causal relationship between ELIP and EGME, as it lies above the extinction level and beneath the volcanic pile of ELIP. In this project, multiple methods are used to provide the origin, mechanism and possible we
