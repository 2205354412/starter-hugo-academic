Master degree research project, supervised by Prof Jian Cao.

Back Ground and Aim: 

A large carbon isotope excursion(over 8 â€°) has been documented at the end of Capitanian in South China and its cause has been elusive. Different explanations has been aroused but robust evidence is still not available. These explanations include:1) The light carbon bringing by upwelling currents from deep ocean; 2)The light carbon from re-oxidated organic matter in the strata; 3) Light carbon from volcanic activity(The Emeishan Large Igneous Province). In this study, we use element content to decode the palaeoenvironment information(upwelling character, redox condition, primary productivity) of  a well preserved section(the Shangsi section) in South China and try to provide some information behind the excursion.

Present Progress:
